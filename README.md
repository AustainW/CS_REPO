Android Capstone repository

Src, res, and AndroidManifest files for my CS Capstone project: PLU Points Of Interest

Do create your own from these files download them into a folder somewhere on your computer.
Make sure you have the Android sdk plugin for eclipse downloaded on your computer!!
Create your own android project from existing code and search for the folder you saved the files in
Eclipse will create the new prject from the files and there you have it.
